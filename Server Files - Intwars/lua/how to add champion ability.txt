To start create a folder for your champion and in that folder create a file Q/W/E/R.lua, where the first letter is the ability slot(first ability q, ultimate r)
Then add functions finishCasting() and applyEffects(). On finishCasting() create projectiles if needed. To create a projectile use addProjectile(toX, toY) , projectile id and speed will be automagically loaded

You need to use some basic vector math for most skills so they aren't unlimited range, hope you didn't sleep during math classes. see ezreal skills for examples

If you added a projectile, add debuffs damage etc to applyEffects()

See champion spell lua api text file in this folder for list of all methods avaiable in Lua
